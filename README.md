# hdest-dustfx
> personally, i recommend using [HDFX](https://github.com/JRHard771/HDFX/) with this

Originally called "lazyhitsparks" (because i really didn't put much effort into it lol), DustFX is a simple mod that just adds some "fancy" dust-related effects to HDest.

Heavily inspired by F.E.A.R's effects.

## some notes
Currently, only bullets and explosions (including wall-explosions) create dust. Might add more dust elsewhere.

Also particles are not saved into savefiles, so the effects will just vanish when you reload a save.

## Credits:
- Shampooh - initial idea for the dust effects
- potetobloke - ideas and coding the initial particles and timings (thank you for adding roll to the textures)
